This code shows the percentage of CPU usage per second using the /proc/stat directory. 
If it exceeds the threshold value, it shows an error message.

#use with parameter to run the code from terminal ForExample: 
$go run CPUsage.go 20 $go run file.go "percent"

Interchangeable features:
1-threshold value  #Current %10 , u can change this.
2-second intervals #Current 1sec, u can change this.
